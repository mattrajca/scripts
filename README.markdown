scripts
=======

A bunch of useful Bash and Python scripts. These can be made into OS X Services by copying and pasting the contents of the scripts into a "Run Shell Script" action of an Automator workflow. Be sure to select the proper shell (either Python or Bash) for the script. Once saved as an OS X Service, you can run these scripts by right-clicking on files, text, etc... in any Cocoa application.
